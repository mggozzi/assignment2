        "\n",
        "3) This first sentence means that all tidy data sets are the same, allowing for easy understanding and analysis.  There is only one way to be a tidy data set, but there are many ways to be a messy data set.  The 'mess' can take many different forms.  Tidying solves all of the potential 'messy' problems / irregularities.  The second sentence means that in determining observations and variables is straightforward in individual contexts.  If you try to generalize these definitions, however, the assumptions that applied to one situation will likely not apply to all.  Variable and observations should be understood based on the context they are described in.\n",
        "\n",

        "6) The 5 most common problems with messy data are: column headers as values rather than variables, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables being stored in both rows and columns, multiple observational units being stored in the same table, and a single observational unit being stored in multiple tables.  The data in Table 4 are messy because variables are forming both columns and rows, and the column headers are values rather than variable names.  Melting a dataset involves moving data from columns that are NOT variables into rows- the old columns are combined into variable columns.\n",

        "8) The 'chicken and egg problem' with tidy data is that tools used to tidy data and the tidy data itself are linked to each other.  Wickham states that 'tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it'.  He hopes that in the future, methodologies from other fields including user-centered design, human-computer interaction, and human factors will be used to improve the general understanding of the cognitive side of data analysis."
